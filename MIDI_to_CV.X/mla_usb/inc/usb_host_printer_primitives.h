  Function:
    int16_t PrintScreen( uint8_t address, USB_PRINT_SCREEN_INFO *printScreenInfo )

  Summary:
    This routine will extract the image that is currently on the specified
    portion of the graphics display, and print it at the specified location.

  Description:
    This routine is intended for use in an application that is using the
    Graphics Library to control a graphics display.  This routine will
    extract the image that is currently on the specified portion of
    the graphics display, and print it at the specified location.
    Since the display may be in color and the printer can print only black
    and white, the pixel color to interpret as black must be specified in the
    USB_PRINT_SCREEN_INFO structure.

    The function can be compiled as either a blocking function or a
    non-blocking function.  When compiled as a blocking function, the routine
    will wait to enqueue all printer instructions.  If an error occurs, then
    this function will return the error.  If all printer instructions are
    enqueued successfully, the function will return -1.  When compiled as a
    non-blocking function, this function will return 0 if the operation is
    proceeding correctly but has not yet completed.  The application must
    continue to call this function, with the same parameters, until a
    non-zero value is returned.  A value of -1 indicates that all printer
    instructions have been enqueued successfully.  Any other value is an error
    code, and the state machine will be set back to the beginning state.

  Precondition:
    None

  Parameters:
    uint8_t address                            - USB address of the printer.
    USB_PRINT_SCREEN_INFO *printScreenInfo  - Information about the screen
                            area to print, how to interpret the screen image,
                            and how and where to print the image.  Note that
                            the width and height members of the structure do
                            not need to be filled in by the application.

  Return Values:
    0       -   Non-blocking configuration only.  Image output is not yet
                complete, but is proceeding normally.
    (-1)    -   Image output was completed successfully.
    other   -   Printing was aborted due to an error.  See the return values
                for USBHostPrinterCommand().  Note that the return code
                USB_PRINTER_SUCCESS will not be returned.  Instead, (-1) will
                be returned upon successful completion.

  Remarks:
    None
